
Patients are labeled "Subject" and numbered 1 through 30.

Six activities labeled "Activity" are described below:
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING

Features were grouped according to "Subject" and "Activity" and analyzed to find mean value per group.
Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
